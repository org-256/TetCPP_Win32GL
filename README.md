# TetCPP_Win32GL

The new experemental version of a tetris game.
I was trying to implement tricky representation method of a tetraminos ( class Figure )...
The idea was to keep four 2D vectors of offsets of a tetramino parts relatively to it's origin.
This method is way much easier to implement and much more safer for boundaries checking.
I was a bit lazy to implement ScoreBoard and InfoBar. 
Anyway I glad if it could help you out somehow.
